"""In Python, there are four basic types of functions:

Built-in functions: These functions are built into the Python interpreter, and can be used without the need for an import statement.
Examples include print(), len(), and type().

User-defined functions: These functions are created by the user using the def keyword, and can be called from anywhere in the
 program. They allow you to encapsulate a block of code and reuse it throughout your program.

Anonymous functions: Also known as lambda functions, these are small functions that can be defined inline without the
 need for a def statement. They are typically used for short, simple operations.

Recursive functions: These functions call themselves to perform a particular operation, and are typically used to
 solve problems that can be broken down into smaller sub-problems. Recursive functions must have a base case that
   stops the recursion, or else they will run indefinitely.
