'''In programming, a list is a data structure that stores a collection of items,
 such as numbers or strings, in a specific order. Lists are commonly used in programming because they allow you to easily 
 manipulate and iterate over a group of related values.

To reverse a list, you can use the reverse() method in Python'''

mlist = [1,2,5,1,26]

mlist.reverse()
print(mlist)
